Please keep the file name as 'breed1' which is named exactly in the python script.

Step 2 : Incase you want to run the file in your local, please download the data(https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OoqIY24zKMxp_oqJ6PkaL1xxPDMcyDqnMvgfYP8I908/edit#gid=768206144)
from here and proceed with running the script.

Step 3 : Two different python script can be seen. Python script 1 is all about analysis.
